### Project Definition

The main goal of this project is to find the sentiment of the stocks using Google news headlines.

#### Project Story

At first the project aimed to find the sentiment of the stocks using twitter tweets but after sometime I found that there are not much of tweets for certain stocks.
So I came with an idea of scraping the google news headlines to find the sentiment of the stocks. For scraping method 
**Selenium** is used with Chromedriver and for word tokenizing **NLTK** is used and to find the sentiment analyse **TextBlob** is used, to deploy the model **Streamlit** is used.
